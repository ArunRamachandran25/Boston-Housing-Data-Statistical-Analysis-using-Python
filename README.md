# Boston-Housing-Data-Statistical-Analysis-using-Python
The code sample is from the Boston Housing Data Analysis which was performed using Python. The code basically involved various data visualizations on the columns and thereby extracting meaningful information from the graphs like Scatter Plots, Boxplots. Then we used those graphs for analysis via hypothesis testing like code sample included t-test, ANOVA, Correlation and other metrics to extract information which supports the visualizations we prepared. It also contains Linear Regression to create a machine learning model to support our analysis.  The code sample included Pearson test for continuous variables and Chi-Square Test for the categorical variables.
